This is an offline chatting software that I've created to level up my web development skills. 
Everything has been developed from scratch & I'm grateful that I got such an opportunity.
At this time, this software is for personal use only, if you're interested in this
feel free to shoot an email at: ak.plus.gold@protonmail.com

I'm just documenting my web development portfolio on this account for future reference.
