This is an offline chatting software that I've created to level up my web development skills. 
Everything has been developed from scratch using html/css, JS and NodeJS code.
At this time, I do not have any plans to release a paid version of this software.
I'm just documenting my web development progress here as future reference.

  + Message history, & session management
